NAME
    isOlderThan.exe - Check if a file is older than specified time period

SYNOPSIS
    isOlderThan.exe <filepath> [options]

DESCRIPTION
    isOlderThan checks whether a file is older than a specified time period.
    The program compares the file's modification time against a reference time
    calculated from the current time minus the specified age threshold.

    By default, if no time specification is provided, the program checks if
    the file is older than 6 months.

    The reference time calculation can use either the exact current time
    (with -exact) or the end of the previous day (default behavior).

REQUIRED PARAMETER
    <filepath>      Path to the file to check
                    Can be absolute (C:\path\to\file.txt) or relative (file.txt)
                    Supports both forward slashes (/) and backslashes (\)

OPTIONAL TIME PARAMETERS
    -days <count>   Number of days
                    Excludes all other time parameters (-weeks, -months, -years)
                    Example: -days 30

    -weeks <count>  Number of weeks
                    Excludes all other time parameters (-days, -months, -years)
                    Example: -weeks 4

    -months <count> Number of months
                    Can be combined with -years (maximum 11 when combined)
                    Example: -months 6

    -years <count>  Number of years
                    Can be combined with -months
                    Example: -years 2

TIME REFERENCE MODE
    -exact          Use exact current program execution time as reference
                    Default: uses end of previous day as reference

PARAMETER RULES
    • -days excludes all other time parameters
    • -weeks excludes all other time parameters
    • -months can only be combined with -years
    • When -months and -years are combined, months must be ≤ 11
    • Default behavior: end of previous day reference time
    • -exact mode: current program execution time reference

TIME CALCULATION
    The program performs accurate calendar arithmetic, properly handling:
    • Leap years according to Gregorian calendar rules
    • Variable month lengths (28-31 days)
    • February 29 boundary conditions in non-leap years
    • Year and month overflow normalization

EXIT CODES
    0   File is older than specified period (success)
    1   Invalid arguments or file is not older than specified period
    2   File not found
    3   File access error (permissions, I/O error)
    4   Invalid parameter combination
    5   Invalid parameter value (negative numbers, etc.)

EXAMPLES

    Basic Usage:
    ------------
    Check if file is older than default 6 months:
        isOlderThan.exe C:\temp\myfile.txt

    Check if file is older than 30 days:
        isOlderThan.exe C:\Documents\report.doc -days 30

    Check if file is older than 2 weeks:
        isOlderThan.exe .\backup.zip -weeks 2

    Check if file is older than 1 year and 6 months:
        isOlderThan.exe "C:\Program Files\app\config.ini" -years 1 -months 6

    Check with exact current time reference:
        isOlderThan.exe C:\logs\app.log -months 3 -exact

    Batch Script Usage:
    ------------------
    @echo off
    isOlderThan.exe "C:\temp\cache.dat" -days 7
    if %ERRORLEVEL% == 0 (
        del "C:\temp\cache.dat"
        echo Removed old cache file
    ) else (
        echo Cache file is still current
    )

    PowerShell Usage:
    ----------------
    if (& .\isOlderThan.exe "C:\logs\debug.log" -days 30) {
        Remove-Item "C:\logs\debug.log"
        Write-Host "Removed old debug log"
    }

TECHNICAL DETAILS

    Calendar Arithmetic:
    -------------------
    The program implements proper calendar arithmetic:
    • Leap year calculation: (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || (year % 400 == 0)
    • Month addition handles varying month lengths correctly
    • February 29 dates are adjusted to February 28 in non-leap years
    • All calculations use local system timezone

    File Time Retrieval:
    -------------------
    File modification times are retrieved using Windows-compatible stat() calls,
    ensuring proper handling of NTFS timestamps and timezone information.

    Path Handling:
    -------------
    • Supports both Windows backslash (\) and Unix forward slash (/) separators
    • Handles long file paths and Unicode filenames
    • Properly processes quoted paths with spaces

INSTALLATION

    Manual Installation:
    -------------------
    1. Copy isOlderThan.exe to a directory in your PATH
       (e.g., C:\Windows\System32 or C:\Program Files\isOlderThan\)
    
    2. Copy this help file to the same directory

    Using Make (with MinGW):
    -----------------------
    make install-windows

ENVIRONMENT
    The program respects Windows timezone settings and regional configurations
    for accurate time calculations.

TROUBLESHOOTING

    Common Issues:
    -------------
    • "File not found" - Check file path and ensure file exists
    • "File access error" - Verify read permissions on the file
    • "Invalid parameter combination" - Review parameter rules above
    • "Invalid parameter value" - Ensure all numeric values are positive

    Path Issues:
    -----------
    • Use quotes around paths containing spaces: "C:\Program Files\file.txt"
    • Both forward slashes and backslashes work: C:/temp/file.txt
    • Relative paths work from current directory: .\subfolder\file.txt

    Permission Issues:
    -----------------
    • Run Command Prompt as Administrator if accessing system files
    • Ensure the file is not locked by another application
    • Check NTFS permissions on the target file

ERROR MESSAGES
    Error: File path is required
        → Provide a file path as the first argument
    
    Error: -days requires a value
        → Specify a number after -days parameter
    
    Error: Days must be positive
        → Use positive numbers only (> 0)
    
    Error: -days excludes all other time parameters
        → Don't combine -days with -weeks, -months, or -years
    
    Error: When combined with -years, -months can have maximum value of 11
        → When using both -years and -months, months must be ≤ 11

COMPATIBILITY
    • Windows 7 and later
    • Windows Server 2008 R2 and later
