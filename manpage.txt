.SH NAME
isOlderThanSixMonths \- checks if a file is older than 6 months

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B isOlderThanSixMonths
.I file_path
.br
.B isOlderThanSixMonths
.B \-h|\-\-help

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isOlderThanSixMonths
checks if a file's modification date is older than 6 months. The calculation follows the same logic as Excel's DATEDIF function with the "m" parameter for months.

The script uses the file's modification date (mtime) and compares it with the current date. The month calculation takes into account different month lengths and follows the logic:

.nf
Months = (Today_Year - File_Year) Ã— 12 + (Today_Month - File_Month)

If Today_Day < File_Day:
    Months = Months - 1
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I file_path
The full path to the file to be checked.

.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help

.TP
.B 0

.fi

Usage in a shell script:

.B     echo "File is older than 6 months"
.B     # Further actions...
.B else
.B     echo "File is still current"
.B fi
.fi

Usage with find to delete old backup files:
.nf
.B find /backup -name "*.bak" -type f -exec sh -c '
.B     if isOlderThanSixMonths "$1"; then
.B         echo "Deleting old file: $1"
.B         rm "$1"
.B     fi
.B ' _ {} \\;
.fi

Checking exit codes:
.nf
.B isOlderThanSixMonths /path/to/file.txt
.B case $? in
.B     0)   echo "File is older than 6 months" ;;
.B     1)   echo "File is younger than 6 months" ;;
.B     255) echo "File not found" ;;
.B     254) echo "Error during execution" ;;
.B esac
